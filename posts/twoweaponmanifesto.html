      <h2>Two Weapon Manifesto</h2>
      <p>Life is expansionary. All that lives will never be content, and will seek to fulfill their ever-expanding desires. Human civilization is not the result of milllions of years of natural development, but of rapid spreading ideas. Ideas of religion, of kingdoms. What she takes from earth will not replenish for she sits on a throne far above the natural balance of life. This makes her greed the measuring stick of how long she will live.
<br><br>
As with all life, things fall apart. Civilizations too. But as one civilisation falls, another one succeeds. That is the pendulum of life. However, mankind is devious and inherit a tremendous power. Its greed and hunger pollute the ground on which life can exist with two weapons; two weapons that feed their desire, two weapons that are aimed as much on themselves as on their enemy, two weapons that will break the oscillating rhythm of life once and for all: radioactivity and PFAS.
<br><br>
These two weapons defile planet earth, guaranteeing that of all civilizations this will be the last. Paired with our neverending greed and desires, our corruption of earth will have the pillars of life fall, one by one. It tips the scale, it throws life into unbalance. The earth will quake, the air will boil, and our heavens will crackle. Slowly but steadily the intensity increases until the gates to hell stand wide open embracing us with its warmest welcome.
<br><br>
When Atlas was doomed to hold the heavens on his shoulder, life was destined to be destroyed by man. For when our civilization crumbles, man will die, and Atlas unable to hold heaven up any longer, will drop it onto earth. Left, there will be nothing left but an abyss of darkness.
<br><br>
Mankind has become a plauge, and our weapons are firing. When we think there is peace, war is being fought against our very selves. Every second, every minute, every hour. Hope is rapidly diminishing. Seize our weapons. Cut the hands of those firing. Life was not made for mankind, so don't let us take it with us when we die.
